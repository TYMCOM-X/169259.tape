We are sending the following memo to you as managers in the license tree.
Please ensure that all users under your management comply.

The Validations Department is in the process of updating our current infor-
mation on employees who have status names.

We appreciate your cooperation, and we hope you understand that this is a
necessary step to improve the security of our Network. Basically, it will 
provide accountability, and will give us immediate access to the person that
owns the status name.

This security enhancement is particularly significant in light of the recent
unfortunate publicity about Tymnet Security practices. Call me (X7316) if
you'd like a copy of the article.



We are requesting that anyone who currently has a status name, run our exec
** license.req. This exec will prompt you for the information that we need
in order to update our files. It will be available on or before 12-12-88.

People who have not provided the required information by January 13,1989,
will be barred from setting license after that date.

  An additional thought...  Ken mentioned that they were dialing into the

Debbie,
  Both Ken and Earl are having the problem that things don't work at
1200 baud any more.  They used to work.

  They are able to get things to work if they drop the line speed down
to 300 baud.

  I feel that this is significant, and may help TYMNET isolate the problem.
I will pursue the issue here with people I know in TYMNET as far as known
problems with new (if any) releases of network code.

/Carl
 PS.  Please pass this info on to whomever comes in to look at the engines.

The line to neighbor node 5416 is suspended because that node has no XLINKs

Wayne & Vida & Cynthia,

As I said I would, I have rolled the opername data base into the new system.

However, there is still some amount of testing, and a small matter of making
sure that the license kept on the system password file is not lost.

I also have made all of the programming changes as per our conversation on
Thursday.  As per that meeting, I have noot been felling as well as I would
like and have not done what I consider sufficient testing of the new features
added in the last week.

I will call you (Cynthia) sometime this afternoon to discuss having you do
some "stress-testing" to make sure nothing will break when we make this live
for all users on the system.

PS. Since I am developing on system 33, that is where the current TEST system
resides.  I will move it to 74 today, so I may fix anything that you find
without breaking anything else.

PPS.  Wayne, I would prefer that Cynthia do some amount of double-entering
      using one of these test systems.  I will coordinate with her when and
      where she can start.

PPPS.  Wayne, I do not have the correct ONTYME address for either Cynthia or
       Vida.  COuld you please put a copy of this memo on their desks.

Thanks a lot.

The MAPAL1 stopcode in CRA001.SAV is a result of the Monitor getting confused

Cc: FletcherC 
Subject: Analysis of TRW's MAPAL1 crash. 

LOGINN was running and did an INBUF uuo which caused the low-seg to be
expanded to handle the input buffers.  The kernel did a VCREAT uuo, asking
for 2 writeable pages starting at user virtual page 2.  One page was
allocated and a second one contiguous to the first was requested.  The
MAPAL1 occured when PCBIO was asked to read a bogus SAT page for SWAMP.

Something went wrong in GETPAG while allocating the first page.  It returned
200004,,467125 which is an error; the highest page on an RP06 is 227161 octal.
The bogus disk address was found in ac M and in the UPT and UPT+UPTLMA.
When GETPAG was called the second time, is took the bogus disk address,
calculated the address where the STT would be if the disk had that many
pages, and read random garbage as an STT entry.  It read this garbage as
if it were a retreival pointer and passed it on to PCBIO.  The MAPAL1 crash
is a result of RBREAL not being set on this garbage pointer.

There was no bounds checking in the GETSTT routine in SWAMP.  I put in a
check against UNIPAG.  This will fix this particular MAPAL1 scenario but
until the problem in GETPAG is found, bad data can still get put into the
UPT.  That will cause a PAGPOR (page out of range) stopcode when the page
is faulted in.

I have not checked the logic in GETPAG to find out why it could return a
bogus value.  It may have been that the very last SAT page of the last
unit was in-core and completely full (and the routine fell off the end
of DSKB).			/Joe

Subject: re: TOPS-10 FIle being modified (3) 

Joe,
  I setup FACT.CTL to submit FCTLOG.CTL for /after:+0:05 just before it
finishes.  FCTLOG.CTL simpley renames FACT?.LOG to FACTn.LOG where n is
increased each time it runs, making FACT.LOG ==> FACT1.LOG.

  Well, normally I'd expect this to work... but it doesn't.  It gets the
file being modified error.

  Background:  I foolishly [?] tried having this rename occur while inside
FACT.CTL and (of course, received FIle being modified (3) as the error).
This was earlier this afternoon.  I created FOO.CTL and submitted it as:
  SUBMIT FACT=FOO.CTL/...     then
  SUBMIT FACT/TIME:10:00/UNIQUE:0/AFTER:3:00   to run tonight...

Anyway, I just logged in and FCTLOG ran 5 minutes after FACT completed and
still got the File being modified error.  I tried it by hand, nearly an hour
after BATCON finished running FACT and I got the File being modified error.

Who has the file open?  Why?  Is this a bug in 7.01?

I'd ultimately like to have the FACT.LOG for each day printed and then
renamed to FACTn.LOG and keep 7 copies.  I want the copies on-line for
me to check, otherwise I'd just have BATCON delete it after printing.
I don't want to print an ever-increasing FACT.LOG every day, but I do
want to print it every day for their benefit!

Maybe BATCON does not close the LOG file until another job is scheduled

Vida & Cynthia,

  As per the confusion that you had with "License" and "Privilege" and
"Capability" that I has in the documentation and the testing that Cynthia
had done on system 74, I have changed the name of one of the fields:

  Instead of calling it "License" it is now called "Capability" and is
both listed as "Capability" and the new prompt says "Capability (MG LG):".

  I showed the documentation to the members of my group and they had the
same questions.  Thus, I expect everyone will have the same questions and
so it has been changed...

Subject: TAUX reports strangely in middle of sup swap. 

At 00:05 I tried to TAUX to XRAY:8671 to look at X32's base from F33.
It kept saying "access barred".  I tried from X14, which said "no such host".
I tried from D25, and got a long delay.  Trying to build a new circuit from
the mux produced "ISIS unable to complete request".  That's when I realized
it was 3 very different symptoms of the same problem.  The SUP took over
F33's base at 00:06:29 PST and D25's base at 02:06:32 CST, at which time
the TAUX on D25 finally got through.

Moral of the story: If the network is acting crazy, try again in 30 seconds.

Give DEBBIE license just like JKRIVANEC.

Since RPMOP is our group id to make changes for the accounts we

Carl, after much discussion it looks as though we need to pass
the username to CPIP.  It needs to go into the field that the PPN is
presently occupying.PIP doesn't need the PPN for billing,
the MCN is important to them.  AT&T needs the username with study
type on the end for their billing.  Bob Brown is not going to use the
data that we have sent them so far because we will need to rerun it with
the username put in.  You will need to give him a call and he will discuss
with you how best to give him the new data.  Please give me a call on
Monday and let me know how long it is going to take you to modify your
program.  If you have any questions, please give me a call.  Thanks,

     I must countermand Jan Krivanec's 1/27/89 memo.  I am sorry about
     the confusion.

     I have been working for some time to upgrade the security features
     of SETOP.  It is finally now being implemented.  Although we have
     tried to make the upgrade as transparent as possible, part of that
     plan is to have all of Network Systems under Network Systems
     control.  Therefore, TYMNET Validations will manage SETOP functions
     for Network Systems.  You all still have your own manager functions,
     as before, but now with more flexibility.  The only added control is
     at the time a new user name is added.  That function will go through
     an audit by TYMNET Validations to insure proper information is in
     the database (of course, we are working the current "cutover
     problem" of getting all existing names and owners in the database).

     Specifically, the following (and others) are to be under MDNSC:

Vida & Cynthia,
  As per our discussion on Friday, OPPS has now been modified to allow
users to change their OPER passwords and update the NEW setop data files.
OPPS is now ONLY on system D34.

  A possibly new feature is that a manager need not run SETOP just to
change a user's OPER password, whereas previously you were only allowed
to change your own password with OPPS.  It now validates the user by
requesting an opername and password, then allows the user to change any
opername that is on that user's particular branch.

I looked at GFD.MAC and it appears that someone put in the code to prevent

INIT and DEVPPN... why a problem?  DEVPPN skips and they stored the result
in SYSPPN at DEVPPN+1 so the later compare always checked against [0] and
never worked.

Fix: In GFD %14.7, add JFCL after DEVPPN call.  Telecopied to (OSU:*) Please

As we had thought, SETE both in the monitor and the program had been

overlooked.

I will telecopy it everwhere (OSU:*)SETE.SAV, although the source is (MPL).
This is a monitor utility and belongs in (OSU) due to it's nature.

Subject: SETOP cutover and changes 

This is to inform you that the newest release of SETOP has been installed
on system D34. The changes include:

 o  Opernames with no employee number are written to the password file
    as before, except their license field is 0.  If they try to set their
    license they receive the message "Did not set OP".  In effect they
    are disabled until their ISG/Employee numbers are entered.

 o  The DATES and NODATES commands have been added.  These commands control
    the printing of the password change date information as in the old
    version of SETOP.

 o  SM capability has a new meaning.  SM (Setop Manager) allows the user
    to create and delete oper names and otherwise manage the entire tree.

 o  BM capability (Branch Manager) allows the user to create and delete
    oper names and otherwise manage the current branch including all of
    its sub-branches and leaves.

 o  The IMITATE command now requires SU (Setop Utility) capability in
    order to properly record the "on behalf of" license grant.

 o  SU capability has been removed from all oper names other than ROOT
    and that of the SETOP maintainers.  Albeit this will make it slightly
    more difficult to grant license on behalf of a manager, it is felt
    that anyone that needs to grant license, understand how to do it and
    manage that responsibility themselves.  VALIDATIONS WILL NOT grant
    the actual license to the individual oper names, and therefore does
    NOT need the ability to grant license "on behalf" of another user.

What causes POSSIBLE COMPILED CODE-RUNTIME INCOMPATIBILITY?
I ran into it trying to rebuild MAILER.SAV from (TUMS)MAILER.CMD.

Date: Tue, 7 Feb 89 3:58:49 PST 
To: Joe Smith <JMS> 
Subject: Re: RUNTIME IN-COMPATIBILITY 

Well... it's like this, FTSYS:SAIL and SYS:SAIL produce identical code at
the moment, however it has NOT always been this way.  There is ONE major
factor that separates these two released versions of SAIL.  They have a
different compiler/runtime version number assembled into them.

Thus, when you link code that has been compiled with one or the other
together, there is this little INIT procedure that gets called at runtime
which makes sure we're all using the same runtimes by checking what version
each module was compiled with.

Whenever it finds one that doesn't match, it complains... unfortunately, it
was never made to understand to tell the poor user what the version numbers
or what modules are at fault.

In NDT, Scott had a program which printed out these version numbers, but it
would take some work to locate it and fit it into TUMS.

To complicate matters, any "require" files that reference (SAILIB), have
an other set of idiosyncracies... they have compile-time switches that check
the compiler version and they attempt (and are 95% right) to load the library
.REL file that matches the right compiler versions.  That's why you'll find
APPEND.REL and APEND.REL, etc... See (SAILIB)SAIL.DEF for some gore... esp.
see the section on get!module or get!library...

Either one or more of the library versions do not match.  Check your RPG.INI
to see what version of SAIL you are using to compile with... Bill may have
used a different version.  Usually (FTSYS) vs (SYS) is the biggie.

Subject: Re: Setting LICENSE of F33 

Um.. my fault actually, F33 is my test host for the new SETOP program and
I turned the switch to only write validated OPERnames to the password file.

My fault, because the database I was using was a 2-week old base that didn't
have any (read *ANY*) users validated properly with their ISC employee numbers
so, although everything was written correctly on D34, when I exited my test
copy on F33, it clobbered the real file with stale data.

You had an opername that had 0 license.  Since you said O... without asking
for explicit licenses, it said, oh.. you want, let me see.. nothing, OK! and
set nothing(!) so it didn't complain, 'cuz your password and all was alright.

The other problem is that it would fix itself when the password-file daemon
runs, but that happens to be every 150 minutes (read 2.5 hours).  I got a
call from operations and I fixed it!

FYI... the newest latest greatest version is this hour now running on D34.
       It is a little kinder about some things, and now enforced the TYMNET
       password standard of nothing trite, nothing short, nothing without
       an embedded non-alpha, etc...                  (up 2, "d" should be "s")

Carl,
  Ron and I were playing with SETOP and had a few questions that don't seem
to have obvious answers.
  What is BM capability?  Is it anything like SM?
  How does someone get LG capability?  People like Ed Mooring (license name
ETM) have traditionally run much of the oper stuff for us and QA, but he
doesn't have LG.  Does he even need it to continue to manage existing names
and their licenses?

I had operations "STORE G3" on B39 and restore on X32 with "MODE OLD NEW" so
that system 32 should have the most recent files.  I'm sure F74 is not up
to date.

I don't know if B39's packs are still mounted; you'd have to ask the Fremont
Data Center.  If not, you could have them restore (SAILIB) from B39's final
all-files tape to some other directory on X32 or F74.

1. is 39 still up somewhere (i.e. 39's packs)?
2. any idea on problems with PEAK, still getting complaints.  Error code
   says file not found (SYS)PEAK from FRMRUN.  I think maybe an old version
   of FRMRUN library on 74 that causes problems?

GENTLEMEN,

    I WANTED TO FIND OUT IF THE TYMCOM-X GROUP STILL DOES THE
PDP-10 BASE CODE GENERATION. THERE IS A PROJECT #47582 TO REMOVE A 9.6
HARDWIRE AND INSTALL A MEMORY SHUFFLER LINK FROM NODE 4261 TO EBUS
NODE 7004. THE PROJECT LISTS THE BOUND FILE IN THE TYM5 DIRECTORY IS TO
BE LOADED INTO 7004 BUT I NOTICED THE NW7004.BND FILE IS ONLY 63 PAGES
LONG AS COMPARED TO THE TYPICAL 69 PAGES FOR EBUS NODES. I WOULD APPRECIATE
YOUR RESPONSE ON THIS WHEN YOU GET A CHANCE. THE PROJECT IS TENTATIVELY
SCHEDULED FOR WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 15TH AND I WOULD LIKE TO BE SURE
THE CODE FOR 7004 IS GOING TO WORK TO BE SURE HOST 31 ISN'T DOWN ANY
LONGER THAN NECESSARY.

    SO TO SUMMARIZE, NODE 7004 NEEDS THE CODE TO LOOK FOR MS LINKS FROM
SWITCHERS ND4261 AND ND5405. THE HOST INTERFACE SLOT SHOULD NOT
NEED TO BE CHANGED BUT I'LL LEAVE IT UP TO SOFTWARE SUPPORT TO DECIDE HOW

THE CODE SHOULD BE SET UP.

THANKS IN ADVANCE FOR YOUR COOPERATION

Yes, we support the EBUS base code.
I updated ND7004.TYM to have 2 SIO lines and 0 SYNC lines.
The new BND file is (TYM5)NW7004.BND on F33 and D54.
