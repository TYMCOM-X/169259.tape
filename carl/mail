Hello Ed,
  This is a test!  They've finally gotten our internet connection in
place in St. Louis and I can receive internet mail again.

  Feel free to forward this test back so I can see what you received.
I don't know if it will like carl@D35.Tymnet.com or carl@F74.Tymnet.com
as a response... or even carl@opus.Tymnet.com  or cbaltru@antares.Tymnet.com

When our workstations are connected to the campus-wide ethernet here in
San Jose, then I should be able to be reached as carl@doctor.tymnet.com
but in the meantime, oe or all of the above addresses should reach me when
the X.25 link between SanJose and StLouis is up..

This message is sent from D35.Tymnet.com.

Makoto,

I think we have solved your problem. We have added Remote License (RL)
to TOKPRINT. We need you to try SPOOL again. If you still have a problem
we would like to watch the procedures you take to run Spool. In order to
do this, we want to set up a time where Carl Baltrunas and yourself (or
whom the party will be) when you/they tries Spool. Carl is available today.

Please send us an ontyme if you still can not run Spool. We will check our
ontymes frequently this evening.

I am hoping that by adding RL license solved our problems, but if it did
not, we are standing by to help you.

Best regards,
Jan

The current status of the "musical CPUs" is:

KL #1081 (JJJ) was F29, then F26, is now X32 using ND6415.
KL #1307 (XXX) was X32, then X29, is now unused (F29).  ND2100 is unused.
KL #1324 (FFF) was F26, then X32, is now unused (B39).  BB2674 is unused.
KL #1336 (III) was B39, then X39, is now F26 using N10350.

(SYS)SYSTEM.SAV on F26 and X32 have been updated.

Subject: Mail bounce 

Hello Ed,
  This is a test!  They've finally gotten our internet connection in
place in St. Louis and I can receive internet mail again.

  Feel free to forward this test back so I can see what you received.
I don't know if it will like carl@D35.Tymnet.com or carl@F74.Tymnet.com
as a response... or even carl@opus.Tymnet.com  or cbaltru@antares.Tymnet.com

When our workstations are connected to the campus-wide ethernet here in
San Jose, then I should be able to be reached as carl@doctor.tymnet.com
but in the meantime, oe or all of the above addresses should reach me when
the X.25 link between SanJose and StLouis is up..

This message is sent from D35.Tymnet.com.

Please restart (SYS)REDSAT 104457 on F74.  It is marked in the active
area but is not running!  I tried to KILL it and REQUEUE it to no avail.

Please run FNDBAD on this system.  You will find the following:

[6,14422].UFD(USEVAL)

Would you look into it and see if it needs anything done with it?

Thanks Rick

I'll look at it...
  did you kill/cancel/delete REDSAT on F74.  I wasn't sure what it was
supposed to do, and I couldn't find the source on 33 or 74, so I didn't
touch it.  I have lots of mail messages, 2 per hour from F74 about this!

In-reply-to: your message of Tue, 14 Feb 89 14:27:05 PST

I was unable to cancel the original request - it is still in the queue.
The job is to run (SYS)REDSAT.SAV at 16:15 with no log.  The messages were
a result of XEXEC being convinced that the REDSAT job was active even
though no job was logged in as (SYS) at the time.  An hour later, it would
decide that the job had exceeced its time limit, send mail to SYS (which
gets forwarded to us), then rerun the job.  For some strange reason it
thought it had a sub job running, even though it did not log in a new job
and did not graft an existing job.  I have no idea as to what caused it
to finally go to "abort-time" and stay there like it should have in the
first place.  Another case of "the request that would not die".   /Joe

p.s. it looks like your TUMS.INI says F35 instead of D35, no .COM

	My trip to Irvine last week was more productive than I expected.
I am glad we got to meet each other and had a chance to talk.  In the
future I hope to get acquainted with the people who work for you. I am
very much interested in learning more about what you do and your plans
for the M&E and SUN project.  See you here Wednesday.

Subject: The maximum size of DSKB is 3 million pages. 

When the Fremont Operations attempted to add a 26th pack to F33, it exposed
a previously unknown limitation on the size of DSKB.  The DSKCLN program
cannot run if DSKB is bigger than 3,000,000 pages is size.  The maximum
number of units are:

Memorex 3675 (200 Mb/spindle) = 39 units.
Memorex 3650 (300 Mb/spindle) = 25 units.
Memorex 3652 (600 Mb/spindle) = 12.5 drives = 25 logical units.

F33 is currently using only the BPA5 half of BPA5/BPC5; the BPC5 half is
marked as SPARE and is not part of DSKB.

Subject: Dallas had problems with SPOOL; needed SPFIX. 

I ran (DANIELSR)SPFIX on all the Dallas systems; most of them had the
off-by-one bug.  Is there any good reason why we should not put SPFIX
in (UTIL) under the name SPLFIX?  With support going away, Operations
should be left with the tools to fix it themselves.   /Joe

Jan called, saying she was unable to give RF license to RICHARDSON.
I verified the "problem": after granting RF to RICHARDSON and doing a LIST,
it says that he has RA and WF but not RF.  You and I expect that, but
she didn't and Bill didn't.

Suggestion: Make LIST show "RA WF" as "RA(RF,RP) WF(WP)".  (also RC=>SPY)
